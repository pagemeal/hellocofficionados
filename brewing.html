                    <p class="mt-4" id="mt-4">In percolation, the water passes through the coffee grounds, gaining soluble compounds to form coffee. Insoluble compounds remain 
                        within the coffee filter.Coffee can be brewed in several different ways, but these methods fall into four main groups depending on how the water
                         is introduced to the coffee grounds: decoction (through boiling), infusion (through steeping), gravitational feed (used with percolators and in
                          drip brewing), or pressurized percolation (as with espresso).<br>Brewed coffee, if kept hot, will deteriorate rapidly in flavor, and reheating such coffee tends to give it a "muddy" flavour, as some 
                              compounds that impart flavor to coffee are destroyed if this is done.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">The simplest method is to put the ground coffee in a cup, pour hot water over it and let cool while the grounds sink to the bottom. 
                            This is a traditional method for making a cup of coffee that is still used in parts of Indonesia. This method, known as "mud coffee" in the
                             Middle East owing to an extremely fine grind that results in a mud-like sludge at the bottom of the cup, allows for extremely simple 
                             preparation.Boiling, or decoction, was the main method used for brewing coffee until the 1930s and is still used in some Nordic and Middle Eastern
                             countries. The aromatic oils in coffee are released at 96 °C (205 °F), which is just below boiling, while the bitter acids are released when the 
                             water has reached boiling point.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Turkish coffee (aka Arabic coffee, etc.), a very early method of making coffee, is used in the Middle East, North Africa, East Africa,
                             Turkey, Greece, the Balkans, and Russia. Very finely ground coffee, optionally sugar, and water are placed in a narrow-topped pot, called an 
                             cezve (Turkish), kanaka (Egyptian), briki (Greek), džezva (Štokavian) or turka (Russian) and brought to the boil then immediately removed from 
                             the heat. It may be very briefly brought to the boil two or three times. Turkish coffee is sometimes flavored with cardamom, particularly in Arab 
                             countries. The resulting strong coffee, with foam on the top and a thick layer of grounds at the bottom, is drunk from small cups.</p>

                        for use with local-brew coffees in Malaysia, primarily of the varieties Robusta and Liberica which are often strong-flavored, allowing 
                        the ground coffee in the sock to be reused.</p>

                            to the bottom of the pot.Water is placed in the pot, the coffee grounds are placed in the bowl, and the whole apparatus is set 
                            over a burner. As the water heats, it is forced by the increasing vapor pressure up the siphon and into the bowl where it mixes with the
                             grounds. When all the water possible has been forced into the bowl the infusion is allowed to sit for some time before the brewer is 
                             removed from the heat. As the water vapor in the lower pot cools, it contracts, forming a partial vacuum and drawing the coffee down 
                             through the filter.</p>

                         for a few minutes (typically 4–7 minutes) and then the plunger is gently pushed down, leaving the filter immediately above the grounds, 
                         allowing the coffee to be poured out while the filter retains the grounds.</p>

                         surrounded by a filter holder or brew basket. Drip brew makers can be simple filter holder types manually filled with hot water, or they 
                         can use automated systems as found in the popular electric drip coffee-maker.Strength varies according to the ratio of water to coffee 
                         and the fineness of the grind, but is typically weaker in taste and contains a lower concentration of caffeine than espresso, 
                         though often (due to size) more total caffeine.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">Another variation is cold brew coffee, sometimes known as "cold press." Cold water is poured over coffee grounds and allowed to 
                    steep for eight to twenty-four hours. The coffee is then filtered, usually through a very thick filter, removing all particles. This process 
                    produces a very strong concentrate which can be stored in a refrigerated, airtight container for up to eight weeks. The coffee can then be 
                    prepared for drinking by adding hot water to the concentrate at a water-to-concentrate ratio of approximately 3:1, but can be adjusted to the 
                    drinker's preference.  </p>

                    <p class="mt-3">Indian filter coffee uses an apparatus typically made of stainless steel. There are two cylindrical compartments, one sitting on 
                        top of the other. The upper compartment has tiny holes (less than ~0.5 mm). And then there is the pierced pressing disc with a stem handle, 
                        and a covering lid. The finely ground coffee with 15–20% chicory is placed in the upper compartment, the pierced pressing disc is used to 
                        cover the ground coffee, and hot water is poured on top of this disk.</p>

                    <h2 class="title-smal">Espresso</h2>
                    <p class="mt-3">Espresso is made by forcing hot water at 91–95 °C (195–204 °F) under a pressure of between eight and eighteen bars
                         (800–1800 kPa, 116–261 psi), through a lightly packed matrix, called a "puck," of finely ground coffee.It is the basis for many coffee drinks.
                          It is one of the most concentrated forms of coffee regularly consumed, with a distinctive flavor provided by crema, a layer of flavorful 
                          emulsified oils in the form of a colloidal foam floating on the surface, which is produced by the high pressure. Espresso is more viscous 
                          than other forms of brewed coffee. </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">The moka pot, also known as the "Italian coffeepot" or the "caffettiera," is a three-chamber design which boils water in the 
                            lower section. The generated steam pressure, about one bar (100 kPa, 14.5 psi), forces the boiling water up through coffee grounds held in 
                            the middle section, separated by a filter mesh from the top section. The resultant coffee (almost espresso strength, but without the crema) 
                            is collected in the top section. Moka pots usually sit directly on a stovetop heater or burner. Some models have a transparent glass or 
                            plastic top.</p>

                    <p class="mt-3">The AeroPress is another recent invention, which is a mechanical, non-electronic device where pressure is simply exerted by the user
                         manually pressing a piston down with their hand, forcing medium-temperature water through coffee grounds in about 30 seconds (into a single cup.)
                          This method produces a smoother beverage than espresso, falling somewhere between the flavor of a moka pot and a French Press.  </p>
